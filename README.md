# DGG, Custom Wordpress Theme
<h3>The theme</h3>
<p>DGG is a custom Wordpress theme I made for my own website and my own projects. It can be modified, and it's meant to be used with two plugins: <a href='https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/'>Contact Form 7</a> and <a href='http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/'>Advanced Custom Fields</a>. It also uses <a href='http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/'>Slick</a> for the slider of the homepage (which it's not good for the SEO).</p>
<p>This theme have been created with only a footer and a header, and the content in only one column. I have used Skeleton as the base of the CSS, so it's easy to add new templates using the <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> system and its grid to make the website completely responsive. It also has a featured style.css with the color palette written in a comment on the first lines.</p>
<p>Check the code to use the plugins properly!</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Download the theme, and upload it to: <pre>/wp-content/themes</pre></p>
<p>Go to your Wordpress dashboard, click on the appearance menu, and select the DGG theme.</p>
<p>And that's all!</p>
