# DGG, Custom Wordpress Theme
<h3>The theme</h3>
<p>DGG is a custom Wordpress theme I made for my own website and my own projects. It can be modified, and it's meant to be used with two plugins: Contact Form 7 and Advanced Custom Fields.</p>
<p>Check the code to use them properly!</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Download the theme, and upload it to: <pre>/wp-content/themes</pre></p>
<p>Go to your Wordpress dashboard, click on the appearance menu, and select the DGG theme.</p>
<p>And that's all!</p>
<h3>License</h3>
<p>As it's written on the best Wordpress (styles.css) themes...</p>
<p><blockquote>This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.</blockquote></p>
<p>So go to grab it and have fun!</p>
