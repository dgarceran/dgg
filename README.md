# DGG, Custom Wordpress Theme
<h3>The theme</h3>
<p>DGG is a custom Wordpress theme I made for my own website and my own projects. It can be modified, and it's meant to be used with two plugins: <a href='https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/'>Contact Form 7</a> and <a href='http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/'>Advanced Custom Fields</a>. It also uses <a href='http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/'>Slick</a> for the slider of thehomepage (which it's not good for the SEO).</p>
<p>Check the code to use them properly!</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Download the theme, and upload it to: <pre>/wp-content/themes</pre></p>
<p>Go to your Wordpress dashboard, click on the appearance menu, and select the DGG theme.</p>
<p>And that's all!</p>
<h3>License</h3>
<p>As it's written on the best Wordpress (styles.css) themes...</p>
<p><blockquote>This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.</blockquote></p>
<p>So go to grab it and have fun!</p>
<h3>Contact and demo</h3>
<p>The demo is my own website: <a href="http://davidgarceran.com" target="_blank">davidgarceran.com</a></p>
<p>Of course it has been modified for my own purposes, so if you want to ask me something, use <a href="http://davidgarceran.com">this contact form</a>.</p>
